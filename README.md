# Taquin-MultiAgent

This is an auto solving N-Puzzle.

Each agent finds the shortest route to his destination using an A* algorithm while communicating with the other agents until the puzzle is solved.


We can see the simulation on the graphic interface that pops up when we run the code.

(I used intelliJ)
